** Useful Tips **

1. How to know if there exists a specific property/attributes of an object?
- Use Python builtin library - hasattr(object_name, attribute_name)
  : Return value: True if exist. False if not. 
  : Use case -  Used at get_vs_config.py to figure out if a given attribute/optional parameter 
                of a virtual server such as iRule, policy, and so on exists)
                
2. How to update Virtual Server profiles such as http, tcp, ssl client and server, persistence?
- Delete a target profile and create a new one(Create in this context is to update the profile with a new one)
- E.g.: If loaded profile and new profile name is not matching, delete the loaded profile and then create(modify) a new profile
        tx = mr.tm.transactions.transaction
        with TransactionContextManager(tx) as api:
            if loaded_prf_names['httpProfile'] !=  fieldNames['httpProfile']:
                # Update VS profile - Delete and then add
                loaded_httpprf = loaded_vs.profiles_s.profiles.load(partition='Common', name=loaded_prf_names['httpProfile'])
                loaded_httpprf.delete()
                loaded_vs.profiles_s.profiles.create(name=fieldNames['httpProfile'], partition='Common')
                loaded_vs.update()
                #update_httpprf = { 'name':fieldNames['httpProfile']}
                print("HTTP Profile has been updated. Current: %s New: %s" % (loaded_prf_names['httpProfile'],fieldNames['httpProfile'] ))
                pprint.pprint(loaded_httpprf.raw)
            else:
                print("HTTP Profile is NOT updated.  Current: %s New: %s" % (loaded_prf_names['httpProfile'],fieldNames['httpProfile'] ))

3. Python Logging
# Error Log Level: DEBUG INFO WARNING ERROR CRITICAL

import logging

logging.basicConfig(filename='/path/to/log-file.name', level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s %(levelname)s %(name)s %(message)s')
logger=logging.getLogger(__name__)

logger.info("This is an informational log")
logging.info("This is an informational log")

logger.error("This is an error log")

4. Input Type and Ajax auto reload
- If Input Type is "submit" (<input type='submit'>) and there is any associated ajax call, after the ajax call the whole page will be reloaded.
- If Input Type is set as "button" (<input type='button'>) and there is any associated ajax call, after the ajax call the page won't be reloaded.

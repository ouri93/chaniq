# Welcome to the Chan-IQ

## Introduction
**Chan-IQ** has been started as my personal project to understand F5 Python SDK since Apr 5, 2017. In the beginning I just practiced Python programming using F5 Python SDK and over time those codes were unmanageable due to the number of codes. I felt the need of a centralized place to hold those Python codes. Later I expanded the idea so that **Chan-IQ** could provide Graphical User Interfaces(GUI) for end users, store relevant data into DataBase system, and so on and so forth.

I named this project/website as **Chan-IQ** due to the partially functional similarities of F5 BIG-IQ system, where BIG-IQ system manages multiple BIG-IP systems, deploys/modifys/delete configuration objects and so on. Compared to F5 BIG-IQ system, **Chan-IQ** has very limited functionalities such as creating, modifying, deleting configuration objects. Gradually I might add more features and additional functions but there is no guaranteed timeline. For this reason, **Chan-IQ** can't be the replacement of BIG-IQ system. However it would be beneficial for F5 admins who do daily F5 tasks of tedious and repetitive creating, modifying, and deleting F5 configuratios objects.
